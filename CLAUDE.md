## Product Description (Never remove)

**pkg-local MCP - Product Specification**

`pkg-local` is a minimalist Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to understand and comply with locally installed package contracts. It acts as a "librarian" that helps LLMs discover and read actual source code from local development environments, ensuring generated code matches the exact versions and APIs available in the project.

### Vision
Enable LLMs to write code that is perfectly compliant with the actual packages installed in a developer's local environment, eliminating version mismatch errors and API hallucinations.

### Core Philosophy
- **Minimal complexity**: The MCP only locates and serves files; the LLM does the understanding
- **Source of truth**: Always read actual installed code, never rely on documentation or training data
- **Language agnostic**: Start with Python, but architecture supports future language plugins
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with standard project structures

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate API hallucinations**: LLMs read actual source code instead of guessing APIs
2. **Version compliance**: Ensure generated code matches exact installed package versions
3. **Automatic context**: Smart detection of relevant packages based on coding context
4. **Developer efficiency**: No manual documentation lookups or version checking

### Success Metrics âœ… ACHIEVED
- LLM generates code that runs first time without import/API errors âœ…
- Zero configuration required for standard Python and Node.js projects âœ…
- Response time under 1 second for package scanning âœ… (~300ms for 85 packages)
- Works with all major MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, etc.) âœ…

## Permanent Rules (Never remove)

**git add is allowed**: for this project git add and commit is allowed
**WHEN using git commit**: don't add claude marketing at bottom of the commit message

**CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RULE - Bottles Subsystem**: The Bottles Subsystem is STABLE and COMPLETED. DO NOT refactor, redesign, or make architectural changes to the Bottles subsystem. The current implementation is production-ready and battle-tested. Only additions for supporting more package managers (poetry, pipenv, conda, etc.) should be made, following the existing adapter pattern. Any changes to Bottles should be limited to:
1. Bug fixes (if any are discovered)
2. Adding new package manager adapters following existing patterns
3. Minor performance optimizations that don't change architecture
4. Documentation updates
The Shell-RPC engine, Volume Controller, and adapter pattern are final and working perfectly.

**JetBrains MCP Tool Usage**: When explicitly asked to check for code issues or warnings:
- Code inspection: Use `mcp__jetbrains__get_file_problems` with filePath parameter for specific file inspection
- Current file inspection: Use `mcp__jetbrains__get_current_file_errors` for the file currently open in WebStorm
- File search: Can use `mcp__jetbrains__search_in_files_*` when needed (faster than grep/ripgrep)
- Symbol info: Can use `mcp__jetbrains__get_symbol_info` for code understanding
- Refactoring: Can use `mcp__jetbrains__rename_refactoring` for safe renaming
- **IMPORTANT**: Only use these tools when explicitly requested, not automatically
- See `.claude/jetbrains-mcp-tool-instructions.md` for comprehensive usage

**AI Documentation Migration Rule**: When migrating documents from `ai_docs/` to `.claude/history/`:
0. FIRST validate status in all documents and mark completed tasks as COMPLETED
1. ALWAYS use UTC datetime format for filenames: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_original-filename.md`
2. ONLY migrate documents where ALL tasks are COMPLETED
3. For `TODO.md`: Extract ONLY completed tasks to history, keep non-completed tasks in `ai_docs/TODO.md`
4. NEVER migrate documents with pending/incomplete work
5. ALWAYS verify task completion status before migration

**Package Manager Architecture**: Python package managers are not limited to `pip`. Modern Python uses various package managers:
- **pip**: Traditional, uses `requirements.txt`
- **poetry**: Modern, uses `pyproject.toml`
- **uv**: Superior Rust-implemented Python package manager, full replacement for pip/poetry/pipenv, uses `pyproject.toml`
- **pipenv**: Uses `Pipfile`/`Pipfile.lock`
- **conda**: Uses `environment.yml`

All these package managers install packages into the same virtual environment structure (`.venv/lib/python*/site-packages/` or `venv/lib/python*/site-packages/`). The scanner should focus on scanning the virtual environment directories directly, which works regardless of the package manager used. This same principle applies to Node.js package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun) that all populate `node_modules/`.

**Coding Rules & Practices**: Strict adherence to these coding standards:
1. **No Coding Without Confirmation**: Do not start working on coding or execute any task without explicit confirmation
2. **Strong Typing**: Never use `any` type, explicit return types required
3. **No Inventions**: Track current implementation state, adapt to existing codebase
4. **Respect Configuration**: Follow `package.json` imports and `tsconfig.json` strict settings
5. **Code Hygiene**: Lint with ESLint, no unused vars/params, handle all Promise rejections
6. **Module System**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions in imports
7. **Path Aliases**: Use `#` imports as defined in package.json. Run `npm run update-paths` manually when adding new files

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Development mode with watch
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run test        # Run Vitest test suite
npm run lint        # ESLint code quality checks
npm run format      # Prettier auto-formatting
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript type checking
npm run update-paths # Manually generate TypeScript path mappings when adding new files
npm run clean       # Remove all build artifacts and cache
npm run clean:cache # Remove cache files only
```

### TSConfig Path Management
- **Script**: `scripts/generate-tsconfig-paths.ts` maintains TypeScript path mappings
- **When to Run**: Manually run `npm run update-paths` when adding new TypeScript files
- **Coverage**: Scans `src/` directory, generates 55+ `#` import paths
- **Note**: No longer runs automatically before build/test to improve performance

### Testing Notes
- Run tests sequentially to avoid SQLite locking: `npm test -- --pool=forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork`
- All tests pass in clean environment
- Integration tests cover both Python and Node.js environments

### Bottle Integration Test Organization
Fine-grained test structure for multiple package managers:

**Test Categories:**
- `npm run test:bottles:integration:common` - Cross-package-manager compatibility and shared functionality
- `npm run test:bottles:integration:pip` - Pip-specific integration tests
- `npm run test:bottles:integration:uv` - UV-specific integration tests

**CI Pipeline Stages (File-Targeted):**
- `integration-setup-tests` - Fast baseline validation (stage5: integration-setup.test.ts)
- `ci-environment-tests` - Environment-specific validation (stage6: ci-environment.test.ts)
- `pip-integration-tests` - Pip package manager tests (stage7: pip-bottle.test.ts)
- `uv-integration-tests` - UV package manager tests (stage8: uv-bottle.test.ts) 
- `cross-adapter-tests` - Interoperability tests (stage9: cross-adapter-compatibility.test.ts)
- `volume-cache-tests` - Cache validation (stage10: volume-controller-cache.test.ts)

**Directory Structure:**
```
tests/bottles/integration/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/           # Cross-manager tests, CI environment validation
â”œâ”€â”€ pip/             # Pip-specific package manager tests
â””â”€â”€ uv/              # UV-specific package manager tests
```

**CI Test Targeting (Try Fast, Fail Fast):**

**Local Commands:**
```bash
# Target specific file
npm run test:ci:run tests/bottles/integration/pip/pip-bottle.test.ts

# Target specific test function  
npm run test:ci:run-pattern "should install packages using uv add" tests/bottles/integration/uv/uv-bottle.test.ts

# Target test suite
npm run test:ci:run-pattern "Basic Package Installation" tests/bottles/integration/pip/pip-bottle.test.ts
```

**GitHub Workflow Dispatch:**

**ci.yml** (File-Targeted Pipeline):
- test_filter: Applies pattern to ALL 6 bottle integration stages
- Example: `test_filter="Virtual Environment"` runs only those tests across all stages

**test-selective.yml** (Category-Based Testing):
- test_type: Choose category (unit, integration, bottles, bottles-integration, etc.)
- test_filter: Optional pattern within selected category
- skip_build: Skip build step for faster iteration
- Example: `test_type="bottles-integration"` + `test_filter="Virtual Environment"`

**Future Package Managers:**
- Poetry: `tests/bottles/integration/poetry/` + `test:ci:stage12`
- Pyenv: `tests/bottles/integration/pyenv/` + `test:ci:stage13`

## Architecture

**Modular MCP server**: Entry point (`src/index.ts`) â†’ Server (`src/server.ts`) â†’ Tools (scan/read) â†’ Scanners (language-specific) â†’ Adapters (content processing) â†’ Parsers (AST analysis).

**Cache**: SQLite primary, JSON fallback, 40x performance improvement, 1-hour TTL.

### MCP Tools (Simplified Interface v0.2.0)

#### scan-packages
```typescript
interface ScanPackagesParams {
  scope?: 'all' | 'project';  // 'all' = summary mode, 'project' = detailed
  forceRefresh?: boolean;      // Force fresh scan
}
```
- Smart defaults: 'all' scope auto-enables summary mode (99% token reduction)
- Auto-detects Python/Node.js projects, categorizes dependencies
- Returns metadata: version, location, category, language

#### read-package  
```typescript
interface ReadPackageParams {
  packageName: string;  // Only required parameter
}
```
- Returns comprehensive package info with file tree and unified content
- AST extraction for large TypeScript/JavaScript files (99.7% token reduction)
- Lazy loading, security controls, backward compatibility with deprecation warnings

## Key Context & Usage

**Design Principles**: LLM-first, minimal output, accuracy over features, performance critical.

**Best Practices**: 
- Always quote scoped packages: `"@babel/core"` not `@babel/core`
- Use scope 'all' for quick overviews (auto-summary mode)
- Direct MCP calls preferred over Task tool for simple operations

**Compatibility**: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor; Node.js 20+, Python 3.9+; All major package managers.

**Future Priorities** (see `ai_docs/TODO.md`): Additional package manager support (poetry, pipenv, conda), Python AST parsing, performance monitoring. NOTE: Bottles architecture is complete - only new adapters will be added.
