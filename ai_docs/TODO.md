- [ ] Support for other languages (JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Rust) - Note: Node.js support completed in v0.1.0

## Phase 11: Node.js Support Extension
### ‚úÖ All Node.js support tasks completed - See .claude/history/20250815_195901_completed-tasks.md

## Success Metrics (To Be Measured)
- [ ] LLM can generate Python code that runs without import errors
- [ ] Package scanning completes in < 500ms for 50-100 packages  
- [ ] File reading response time < 50ms
- [ ] Zero configuration required for standard Python projects
- [ ] Works reliably with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] All TypeScript strict mode checks pass
- [ ] No runtime type errors in production

## v0.1.1 Performance Tasks
### ‚úÖ All v0.1.1 tasks completed - See .claude/history/20250815_195901_completed-tasks.md

## Notes
- Most "future enhancement" tasks are low priority
- Core functionality is complete and working
- Focus should be on testing, documentation, and performance benchmarking
- Node.js support has been fully implemented in v0.1.0

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Performance Achievements (v0.1.1)
**Reference**: [sqlite-cache-documentation-update.md](./sqlite-cache-documentation-update.md)
- SQLite cache provides 40x faster validity checks
- Response times: scan ~150ms, read ~10ms, cache hits ~5ms
- 90% token reduction achieved for Node.js projects
- WAL mode and prepared statements optimized

### Critical Gaps
**Reference**: [python-implementation-gaps.md](./python-implementation-gaps.md)
- Python implementation significantly behind Node.js
- No dependency categorization or smart prioritization for Python
- Category filtering non-functional for Python projects
- "Dogfooding bias" led to Node.js-centric optimizations

### Architecture Strengths
**Reference**: [mcp-tools-architecture-analysis.md](./mcp-tools-architecture-analysis.md)
- Robust two-tier cache system with automatic migration
- Extensible scanner factory pattern ready for expansion
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable suggestions
- Security measures including path sanitization

### MCP Best Practices
**Reference**: [mcp-tool-performance-analysis.md](./mcp-tool-performance-analysis.md)
- Direct MCP calls 12,000x faster than Task tool for simple operations
- Always quote scoped package names ("@package/name")
- Use summary mode for quick environment overview
- Reserve Task tool for genuinely complex workflows

## Recommended Path Forward

1. **Immediate**: Fix Python parity to match Node.js capabilities
2. **Next**: Implement smart package prioritization for both languages
3. **Then**: Add MCP SDK guardrails for safety and UX
4. **Ongoing**: Complete test coverage and documentation
5. **Future**: Monitor performance and usage patterns for optimization
