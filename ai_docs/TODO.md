## Active Implementation Roadmap

### Priority 1: Python AST Implementation (Future Enhancement)
**Reference**: `ai_docs/wip/bottles-python-ast-strategy.md`
**Status**: 📋 PLANNED - Not critical for current functionality
**Timeline**: TBD

- [ ] **Dual AST Parser Implementation**
  - [ ] tree-sitter-python for fast parsing (<20ms for 100KB)
  - [ ] Python ast module for deep semantic analysis
  - [ ] 95%+ token reduction target for Python files
  - [ ] NO REGEX - specialized tools only

**Note**: Basic Python scanning works well. AST is for future optimization.

### Priority 2: MCP SDK Guardrails (Future)
**Reference**: `ai_docs/wip/mcp-sdk-enhancement-opportunities.md`
- [ ] **Phase 1: Safety Guardrails** (1-2 days when started)
  - [ ] Add read-only validation to all operations
  - [ ] Implement resource-based access control
  - [ ] Enhanced error messages with clear explanations
  - [ ] Add operation logging for transparency
- [ ] **Phase 2: Guided Workflows** (2-3 days)
  - [ ] Context-aware prompts for guided usage
  - [ ] Smart suggestions based on project context
  - [ ] Workflow templates for common use cases

### Priority 3: Testing & Documentation (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Testing Suite Enhancement**
  - [ ] Implement test quality improvements from `bottles-integration-tests-quality-review.md`
    - **Tracker**: See `integration-tests-improvement-tracker.md` for detailed tasks
    - **Validation**: Confirmed by Gemini AI (2025-01-22)
    - [ ] Fix type safety violation (1 critical issue)
    - [ ] Reduce code duplication (30-40% → <15%)
    - [ ] Standardize skip patterns across all tests
    - Note: Console.logs in tests are helpful for debugging - NOT an issue
  - [ ] Add contract tests for adapters
  - [ ] Create test fixtures for faster execution
  - [ ] Add mutation testing with Stryker
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**
  - [ ] Update README with current capabilities
  - [ ] Create performance tuning guide
  - [ ] Add architecture diagrams
  - [ ] Document bottles architecture usage

### Priority 4: Performance Monitoring (Future)
**Reference**: `ai_docs/done/mcp-tool-performance-analysis.md`
- [ ] Add performance monitoring utilities
- [ ] Create benchmark suite for all operations
- [ ] Document performance best practices
- [ ] Monitor real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Track test execution metrics

### Priority 5: Smart Package Prioritization (Future)
**Reference**: `ai_docs/wip/smart-package-prioritization-plan.md`
**Note**: Feature was removed for simplification, may be reconsidered
- [ ] Dependency categorization (if needed)
- [ ] Smart prioritization algorithms
- [ ] Category filtering capabilities

## Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

### Additional Package Manager Support
- [ ] Poetry adapter implementation
- [ ] Pipenv adapter implementation  
- [ ] Conda environment support
- [ ] System-wide package detection

### Language Support Extensions
- [ ] Rust package scanning
- [ ] Go module support
- [ ] Java/Maven integration
- [ ] Ruby gem support

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Import graph visualization
- [ ] Documentation extraction from docstrings
- [ ] Parallel package scanning optimization
- [ ] Incremental index updates
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring and limits

## Success Metrics (Current Status)

✅ **Achieved**:
- LLM generates code that runs without import errors
- Package scanning <300ms for 300+ packages
- File reading <10ms with caching
- Zero configuration for standard projects
- 100% CI pass rate
- All TypeScript strict mode checks pass

🎯 **Target for Future**:
- 95%+ test coverage (currently ~80%)
- <5ms cache hit response time
- 99% uptime in production usage
- <1% test flakiness rate

## Notes

- Bottles architecture is COMPLETE and production-ready
- Python AST is nice-to-have, not critical
- Focus on test quality improvements and documentation
- Most "future enhancement" tasks are low priority
- Core functionality is complete and working well
