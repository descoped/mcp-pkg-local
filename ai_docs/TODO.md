**Status**: üìù IN PROGRESS - Tracking incomplete tasks  
**Date**: 2025-08-15  
**Note**: This document contains only the incomplete tasks extracted from the original TODO. Completed tasks are preserved in history.

## Phase 4: MCP Tools Implementation
### 6. Implement read-package MCP tool
- [ ] Implement streaming for large file content (future enhancement)

## Phase 5: Storage and Caching
### 7. Add index file caching mechanism
- [ ] Create index migration utilities (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add compression for large index files (future enhancement)
- [ ] Implement index file locking for concurrent access (future enhancement)

## Phase 6: Utilities and Helpers
### Additional utility implementations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring utilities (future enhancement)
- [ ] Implement retry logic for file operations (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add telemetry collection (opt-in) (future enhancement)

## Phase 7: Testing
### 8. Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Write unit tests for scanner base class
- [ ] Test Python scanner with mock file systems
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for scanning
- [ ] Test edge cases: empty venv, corrupted packages, permissions
- [ ] Add snapshot testing for MCP responses
- [ ] Implement E2E tests with MCP client simulation

## Phase 8: Documentation
### 9. Write user documentation and examples
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- [ ] Write API.md with detailed tool documentation
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Create examples/ directory with usage examples
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams for documentation
- [ ] Write performance tuning guide

## Phase 9: Performance and Optimization
### Performance improvements (post-MVP)
- [ ] Implement parallel package scanning
- [ ] Add incremental index updates
- [ ] Optimize file tree generation with caching
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and limits
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large packages
- [ ] Add compression for MCP responses
- [ ] Profile and optimize hot paths
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for MCP

## Phase 10: Future Features (v1.1+)
### Nice-to-have enhancements
- [ ] Add auto-trigger mechanism for import detection
- [ ] Implement package alias resolution database
- [ ] Add support for conda environments
- [ ] Create import graph visualization
- [ ] Add support for system-wide packages
- [ ] Implement AST parsing for better code understanding
- [ ] Add documentation extraction from docstrings
- [ ] Support for other languages (JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Rust) - Note: Node.js support completed in v0.1.0

## Phase 11: Node.js Support Extension
### ‚úÖ All Node.js support tasks completed - See .claude/history/20250815_195901_completed-tasks.md

## Success Metrics (To Be Measured)
- [ ] LLM can generate Python code that runs without import errors
- [ ] Package scanning completes in < 500ms for 50-100 packages  
- [ ] File reading response time < 50ms
- [ ] Zero configuration required for standard Python projects
- [ ] Works reliably with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] All TypeScript strict mode checks pass
- [ ] No runtime type errors in production

## v0.1.1 Performance Tasks
### ‚úÖ All v0.1.1 tasks completed - See .claude/history/20250815_195901_completed-tasks.md

## Notes
- Most "future enhancement" tasks are low priority
- Core functionality is complete and working
- Focus should be on testing, documentation, and performance benchmarking
- Node.js support has been fully implemented in v0.1.0
