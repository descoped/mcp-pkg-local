# MCP SDK Enhancement Opportunities

**Status**: üìñ REFERENCE - Future enhancement ideas  
**Date**: 2025-08-15  
**Author**: Claude Code Assistant  
**Context**: Analysis of additional MCP SDK features for guardrails and user experience improvements

## Background

During testing, a user reported that `read-package` was generating TypeScript scripts and performing write operations, which should never happen as it's designed to be read-only. This highlighted the need for better guardrails and transparency in MCP tool operations.

## Current MCP SDK Usage

### What We Currently Use
- **Tools**: `scan-packages` and `read-package` with basic input schemas
- **Basic Error Handling**: Simple success/failure responses
- **Caching**: File-based caching outside MCP framework

### What We Don't Use (Opportunities)
- **Prompts**: Guided workflows and validation
- **Resources**: Controlled file access and read-only enforcement
- **Enhanced Schemas**: Detailed validation and constraints
- **Progress Notifications**: Transparency for long-running operations

## MCP SDK Features for Guardrails

### 1. Prompts for Guided Workflows ‚úÖ

**Current Problem**: Users can misuse tools or get unexpected results

**MCP Solution**:
```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(ListPromptsRequestSchema, async () => ({
  prompts: [
    {
      name: "analyze-dependencies",
      description: "Analyze project dependencies and suggest optimizations",
      arguments: [
        { name: "project_type", description: "Type of project (python/nodejs)", required: true },
        { name: "focus", description: "Analysis focus (security/performance/unused)", required: false }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "explain-package", 
      description: "Explain what a package does and why it's useful",
      arguments: [
        { name: "package_name", description: "Name of the package to explain", required: true }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "safe-package-read",
      description: "Safely read package information with explicit read-only guarantee",
      arguments: [
        { name: "package_name", required: true },
        { name: "confirm_readonly", description: "Confirm this is read-only (yes/no)", required: true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}));
```

**Benefits for Guardrails**:
- **Guided workflows** instead of free-form tool usage
- **Input validation** before execution
- **Contextual help** with argument descriptions
- **Prevents misuse** by providing structured interactions

### 2. Resources for Access Control üîí

**Current Problem**: Direct file system access without transparency

**MCP Solution**:
```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => ({
  resources: [
    {
      uri: "package://scan-results",
      name: "Latest Package Scan Results", 
      description: "READ-ONLY: Cached package scan data",
      mimeType: "application/json"
    },
    {
      uri: "config://project-settings",
      name: "Project Configuration",
      description: "READ-ONLY: Detected project management configuration",
      mimeType: "application/json"
    },
    {
      uri: "package://nodejs/typescript",
      name: "TypeScript Package Files",
      description: "READ-ONLY: TypeScript package source files",
      mimeType: "text/plain"
    }
  ]
}));

server.setRequestHandler(ReadResourceRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  const { uri } = request.params;
  
  // Enforce read-only access
  if (uri.startsWith("package://")) {
    const packageName = uri.split("/")[2];
    return await safeReadPackage(packageName);
  }
  
  throw new Error("Unauthorized resource access");
});
```

**Benefits for Guardrails**:
- **Controlled file access** - only expose specific package files
- **Read-only enforcement** - prevent accidental writes
- **Resource validation** - check permissions before access
- **Audit trail** - track what resources were accessed

### 3. Enhanced Tool Descriptions üìù

**Current Problem**: Unclear tool behavior and constraints

**MCP Solution**:
```typescript
{
  name: "scan-packages",
  description: `
    Scan project packages with intelligent filtering. 
    
    üîí READONLY OPERATION - Never modifies files or generates code
    ‚ö° Optimized for LLM consumption with 90% token reduction
    üéØ Smart prioritization of project-declared dependencies
  `,
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      limit: {
        type: "number",
        description: "Max packages to return (1-200). Default: 50 for optimal LLM performance",
        minimum: 1,
        maximum: 200,
        default: 50
      },
      filter: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Regex pattern for package names. Example: '^react' for React packages",
        pattern: "^[^/\\\\]*$"  // No file paths allowed
      },
      forceRefresh: {
        type: "boolean",
        description: "Force rescan (may take 2-5 seconds). Default: use cached results",
        default: false
      }
    },
    additionalProperties: false  // Prevent unexpected parameters
  }
}
```

### 4. Progress and Transparency Features üìä

**Current Problem**: Long operations happen without user feedback

**MCP Solution**:
```typescript
// Progress notifications for transparency
server.notification({
  method: "notifications/progress", 
  params: {
    progressToken: "scan-123",
    value: {
      kind: "report",
      message: "[SCAN] Processing 304 packages... (READ-ONLY)",
      percentage: 45
    }
  }
});

// Logging for audit trail
server.notification({
  method: "notifications/message",
  params: {
    level: "info",
    logger: "mcp-pkg-local",
    data: {
      operation: "read-package",
      package: "typescript", 
      filesAccessed: ["package.json", "lib/index.d.ts"],
      readOnly: true,
      duration: "23ms"
    }
  }
});
```

## Practical Guardrail Applications

### 1. Read-Only Enforcement
```typescript
// Before any file operation
function validateReadOnlyOperation(operation: string) {
  if (operation.includes("write") || operation.includes("generate")) {
    throw new Error(`
      üö® SECURITY: Attempted write operation blocked
      mcp-pkg-local is READ-ONLY and never generates or modifies files
      Operation: ${operation}
      Contact support if this is unexpected
    `);
  }
}
```

### 2. Project Validation Prompts  
```typescript
{
  name: "validate-project-support",
  description: "Check if current project type is supported before scanning",
  arguments: [
    { 
      name: "expected_type", 
      description: "Expected project type (python/nodejs)",
      enum: ["python", "nodejs", "auto-detect"],
      required: false 
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Smart Filtering Guidance
```typescript
{
  name: "suggest-relevant-packages", 
  description: "Get LLM-optimized package suggestions based on project context",
  arguments: [
    { 
      name: "task_context", 
      description: "What you're trying to accomplish (e.g., 'web scraping', 'API development')",
      required: true 
    },
    { 
      name: "include_dev_deps", 
      description: "Include development dependencies",
      type: "boolean",
      default: false 
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Risks
- **Unclear operation boundaries** - users unsure what tool does
- **File system access** without explicit constraints
- **No audit trail** for operations performed
- **Potential for misuse** without guided workflows

### MCP Solutions
- **Resource-based access control** limits file system exposure
- **Read-only enforcement** prevents accidental modifications
- **Operation logging** provides audit trail
- **Structured prompts** guide proper usage

## Integration Examples

### For LLM Code Generation
```typescript
// Instead of: scan-packages
// Use guided prompt:
{
  prompt: "analyze-dependencies",
  args: {
    project_type: "nodejs",
    focus: "performance"
  }
}
// Returns: Optimized package list with performance recommendations
```

### For Security Analysis  
```typescript
{
  prompt: "security-audit-packages",
  args: {
    include_transitive: true,
    severity_threshold: "medium"
  }
}
// Returns: Security-focused package analysis with vulnerability data
```

### For Development Workflow
```typescript
{
  prompt: "development-package-analysis", 
  args: {
    task: "adding authentication",
    framework: "express"
  }
}
// Returns: Relevant auth packages for Express applications
```

## Conclusion

The MCP SDK provides powerful features beyond basic tools that can significantly improve mcp-pkg-local's safety, usability, and integration capabilities. Implementing these features would:

1. **Solve immediate security concerns** with read-only enforcement
2. **Improve user experience** with guided workflows
3. **Enable advanced use cases** with structured prompts
4. **Provide foundation** for future enhancements

**Recommendation**: Implement Phase 1 (Safety Guardrails) immediately to address the file generation issue, then proceed with guided workflows for improved user experience.

The investment in MCP SDK features will pay dividends in user trust, tool reliability, and extensibility for future development.
