# AI Documentation

This directory contains active planning and tracking documents for the mcp-pkg-local project.

## Structure

### Active Tracking
- **TODO.md** - Primary task tracking document with current and future work items

### Future Work (`future/`)
Documents describing planned but not yet implemented features:
- **python-ast-strategy.md** - Python AST parsing implementation plan
- **nodejs-extraction-enhancements.md** - Node.js source extraction improvements
- **mcp-sdk-enhancements.md** - MCP SDK enhancement opportunities
- **smart-prioritization.md** - Smart package prioritization strategy

### Improvements (`improvements/`)
Ongoing improvement tracking:
- **integration-tests-tracker.md** - Integration test improvement tracking
- **test-quality-review.md** - Test quality analysis and improvements

### Reference (`reference/`)
Technical reference documents:
- **performance-analysis.md** - Performance benchmarks and analysis
- **architecture-analysis.md** - MCP tools architecture overview
- **efficiency-analysis.md** - Node MCP efficiency analysis
- **python-gaps.md** - Python implementation gaps analysis

## Migration Policy

Completed work is migrated to `.claude/history/` with UTC timestamps. Only active planning and future work remains here.

## Principles

- **Active Only**: Only documents with pending or future work
- **Concrete Value**: Each document must provide actionable planning
- **Regular Cleanup**: Completed work migrated to history promptly
