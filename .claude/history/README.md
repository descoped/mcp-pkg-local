# Claude History Directory

This directory contains completed instruction documents that have been fully implemented in the codebase. Each document is prefixed with a UTC timestamp (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) for chronological sorting.

## Document Naming Convention
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_original-filename.md
```

## Completed Documents (Chronological)

### v0.1.0 Implementation
- `20250815_174608_TODO.md` - Completed tasks from original implementation (incomplete tasks in ai_docs/TODO.md)
- `20250815_174609_initial-product-description-and-plan.md` - Product specification

### v0.1.1 Performance Optimizations
- `20250815_174507_nodejs-support-plan.md` - Node.js/npm support implementation
- `20250815_174507_performance-improvements.md` - Token reduction optimizations
- `20250815_174507_query-optimization-analysis.md` - SQL query optimizations
- `20250815_174507_sqlite-cache-enhancement-plan.md` - 40x cache performance improvement
- `20250815_174507_sqlite-indexing-strategy.md` - Database indexing strategy

## Active Documents (in ai_docs/)

### Reference Documentation
- `mcp-sdk-enhancement-opportunities.md` - Future SDK enhancement ideas
- `mcp-tool-performance-analysis.md` - Performance analysis reference
- `mcp-tools-architecture-analysis.md` - Architecture documentation

### Future Planning (v0.2.0+)
- `python-implementation-gaps.md` - Python support enhancements
- `smart-package-prioritization-plan.md` - v0.1.2 intelligent package ranking

## Migration Criteria

Documents are moved to history when:
1. All tasks described in the document are implemented
2. The implementation has been verified in the codebase
3. Tests pass and code is production-ready
4. Status is marked as COMPLETED

## Notes
- Documents are preserved as historical record of development
- UTC timestamps ensure global consistency
- Reference documents remain in ai_docs/ for ongoing use
