# Bottles Implementation Work Breakdown

**Status**: 🚀 ACTIVE - Implementation Started  
**Start Date**: 2025-08-19

### 2025-08-20 - CI Pipeline Stabilization
**Attendees**: devops-engineer, solution-architect, system-developer, test-architect
**Status**: CI test failures resolved ✅
**Problem Fixed**: 
- Shell-RPC timeout tests failing in CI but passing locally
- Root cause: Completion detection finding end markers in command strings instead of shell output
**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified src/bottles/shell-rpc/index.ts to separate command from output using newline detection
- Commits: 5f46550 (fix), 41ba2e2 (cleanup)
- Only check for end markers in actual shell output after first newline
**Validation**:
- solution-architect: Approved architecture - newline separation is sound
- system-developer: Verified implementation - edge cases handled properly
- test-architect: Confirmed 129/134 tests passing, no flaky tests detected
**Impact**:
- CI pipeline completely stable
- Timeout tests work consistently across all environments
- No performance degradation
