# Bottles Implementation Kickoff

**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Team Size**: 7 agents  
**Critical Path**: 28 days

## Immediate Actions Required

### For bottles-architect (Implementation Lead)
1. Review architecture design document
2. Set up project structure for bottles code
3. Begin Volume Controller implementation (can start immediately)
4. Schedule daily standups starting tomorrow
5. Create bottles directory structure

### For system-developer (Start Immediately)
1. Begin Shell-RPC engine implementation - **CRITICAL PATH**
2. Research node-pty vs child_process for implementation
3. Create cross-platform shell detection logic
4. Set up Windows test environment
5. Target: Working prototype by Day 3

### For scanner-engineer
1. Review current Python scanner implementation
2. Plan base adapter interface design
3. Research poetry and pipenv APIs
4. Prepare for package manager integration (starts Week 3)

### For test-architect
1. Inventory current mock tests
2. Plan migration strategy
3. Set up bottle testing framework
4. Prepare validation criteria

### For performance-analyst
1. Set up performance monitoring infrastructure
2. Create baseline benchmarks of current mock tests
3. Prepare diagnostic logging system

## Week 1 Critical Deliverables

**By Wednesday (Day 3)**:
- Shell-RPC prototype working (system-developer)
- Volume controller design complete (bottles-architect)
- Diagnostic system operational (performance-analyst)

**By Friday (Day 5)**:
- Shell-RPC fully functional on all platforms
- Volume controller implementation complete
- Platform compatibility verified
- Initial bottle manager working

## Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Shell Process**: Use node-pty with child_process fallback
2. **Architecture**: In-process bottles with environment isolation
3. **Priority**: pip → uv → poetry → pipenv implementation order
4. **Windows**: Full support with PowerShell preference
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility during migration

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Shell-RPC MUST work on Windows/macOS/Linux by Day 5**
2. **Volume management MUST handle 5GB+ caches efficiently**
3. **Bottle initialization MUST complete in <30 seconds**
4. **Zero regression in existing test suite**
5. **All 4 Python package managers operational by Week 4**

## Risk Mitigations Active

1. **Windows Testing**: Set up Windows CI immediately
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking from Day 1
3. **Fallback Plan**: Maintain mock tests during migration
4. **Cache Management**: Implement size limits from start

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Schedule (UTC)
- 09:00: Daily standup (15 min)
- 14:00: Technical sync if needed (30 min)
- 17:00: Progress check (10 min)

### Escalation Path
1. Technical blocker → bottles-architect
2. Architecture issue → solution-architect
3. Resource conflict → solution-architect
4. Scope change → User decision

## Phase 1 Goals (Weeks 1-2)

### Must Have
- [ ] Shell-RPC working on all platforms
- [ ] Volume controller managing cache
- [ ] Bottle manager creating environments
- [ ] Cross-platform tests passing

### Should Have
- [ ] Diagnostic system with metrics
- [ ] Basic bottle configuration
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms

### Could Have
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Resource Allocation Week 1

| Agent | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| system-developer | Shell-RPC | Shell-RPC | Shell-RPC | Platform | Platform |
| bottles-architect | Volume | Volume | Volume | Manager | Manager |
| scanner-engineer | Research | Research | Planning | Planning | Review |

- [ ] Cleanup working
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Questions Resolved

1. **Q**: Shell process library?  
   **A**: node-pty primary, child_process fallback

2. **Q**: Bottle process model?  
   **A**: In-process with environment isolation

3. **Q**: Windows support level?  
   **A**: Full support required

4. **Q**: Package manager order?  
   **A**: pip → uv → poetry → pipenv

5. **Q**: Backward compatibility?  
   **A**: Must maintain, use feature flags

## Next Steps

1. **TODAY**: All agents review their assignments
2. **TODAY**: system-developer starts Shell-RPC
3. **TODAY**: bottles-architect starts Volume Controller
4. **TOMORROW 09:00 UTC**: First daily standup
5. **FRIDAY**: Phase 1 checkpoint review

## Success Visualization

**Week 1 Success**: Shell-RPC executing commands on all platforms
**Week 2 Success**: Bottle environments being created and destroyed
**Week 3 Success**: pip packages installing in bottles
**Week 4 Success**: All package managers operational
**Week 5 Success**: Tests running against real packages
**Week 6 Success**: Full migration complete, 100+ packages tested

## Team Commitment
