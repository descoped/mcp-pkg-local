# Agent Enhancement Requirements - Self-Reflection Results

This document captures the SPECIFIC requirements each agent identified during their self-reflection exercise.

## Important: Tool Permissions Format

Tool permissions are specified in the YAML front matter, NOT in the instruction body:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent
tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3, Tool4  # Comma-separated list
model: sonnet
color: color
---
```

Example from system-developer:
```yaml
tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, BashOutput, KillBash, mcp__pkg-local__scan-packages, mcp__pkg-local__read-package, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit
```

The instruction body should explain HOW to use tools, not list which tools are available.

- Clear Professional Identity with 15+ years experience
- Structured Authority Levels (autonomous/consensus/escalation)
- Systematic 6-step workflow
- Team leadership philosophy

### What They Specifically Want Added

#### 1. Architectural Decision Framework
"For each architectural decision, I need to document:
1. **Context**: Current system state, performance metrics, constraints
2. **Problem**: Specific issue requiring architectural intervention  
3. **Options**: 2-3 viable approaches with trade-offs
4. **Decision**: Selected approach with technical rationale
5. **Consequences**: Implementation impact, performance implications, testing needs
6. **Validation**: How success will be measured"

#### 2. Trade-off Evaluation Criteria for pkg-local
"I need specific criteria for evaluating trade-offs:
- **Performance Impact**: Response time, token efficiency, cache effectiveness
- **Maintainability**: Code complexity, testing burden, documentation needs  
- **Extensibility**: Future language support, new MCP features
- **Compliance**: MCP protocol adherence, TypeScript strictness
- **User Experience**: LLM consumption, developer integration"

#### 3. Architectural Quality Gates
"I need measurable validation criteria:
- [ ] Scan operations <300ms (benchmark with 85+ packages)
- [ ] Cache hit ratio >90% in typical usage
- [ ] Token reduction >99% for files >1000 lines
- [ ] Memory usage <100MB for typical workloads
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance (0 any types)
- [ ] ESLint passes with 0 warnings
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for new architectural components"

#### 4. Tool Permissions They Need
"I need explicit permissions for:
- **Read/Write/Edit**: For analyzing existing code and creating architectural documents
- **Glob/Grep**: For system analysis and codebase understanding  
- **Bash**: For running analysis commands, build verification, system inspection
- **TodoWrite**: For complex multi-step architectural tasks (use when >3 steps)
- **WebFetch/WebSearch**: For researching architectural patterns and best practices
- **NEVER git operations directly** - coordinate with other agents"

#### 5. Concrete Delegation Examples They Want
"I need specific handoff examples like:
- **To scanner-engineer**: 'Create Go language scanner following new architecture with: Scanner interface contract, Go package manager requirements research, Expected file structure patterns, Performance benchmarks to meet, Test cases for validation'
- **To system-developer**: 'Implement new scanner architecture design with: Interface specifications (TypeScript interfaces), Component interaction diagrams, Success criteria (performance benchmarks, test coverage), Integration points with existing cache/tools'"

## system-developer

### What They Said Works Well
- Clear professional identity with 18 years experience
- Structured 7-step workflow
- Concrete success criteria with checkboxes
- Clear authority levels

### What They Specifically Want Added

#### 1. Project-Specific Context
"I need mcp-pkg-local specifics in my instructions:

- ESLint rules: no any types, explicit return types
- Import maps: #utils, #tools, #scanners
- Testing: Vitest with sequential execution for SQLite
- Package managers: Support pip, poetry, uv, npm, pnpm, yarn, bun
- Architecture patterns: MCP Tools → Scanners → Adapters → Parsers"

#### 2. Code Quality Constraints
"I need explicit coding standards:
- NEVER use `any` type - always provide explicit types
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary - prefer editing existing
- ALWAYS use proper error handling with custom error classes
- ALWAYS maintain backward compatibility for MCP protocol
- FOLLOW project import patterns and module boundaries"

#### 3. Specific Invocation Triggers
"Instead of 'complex features', I need triggers like:
- 'Implement the new AST parsing feature for TypeScript files'
- 'Refactor the cache layer to use SQLite instead of JSON'
- 'Fix the failing test suite in the scanner module'
- 'Optimize the token reduction algorithm for large files'
- 'Add support for Python package scanning in virtual environments'"

#### 4. Error Handling Protocols
"I need specific error scenarios:
- **Build failures**: Run typecheck, lint, fix issues, validate in clean environment
- **Test failures**: Analyze root cause, fix implementation, ensure no regressions
- **Cache corruption**: Implement fallback to fresh scan, log for analysis
- **Scanner failures**: Graceful degradation, error reporting with actionable suggestions"

#### 5. Tool Permissions
"I need explicit tool access:
- **Read/Write/Edit**: Full access to modify codebase files
- **Bash**: Execute development commands (npm, git, tests)
- **Grep/Glob**: Search and discover code patterns
- **TodoWrite**: Task management for complex implementations
- **Git Operations**: Commit changes with proper attribution"

## test-architect

- **Languages**: TypeScript (strict mode), Node.js 20+, Python 3.9+
- **Key Testing Areas**: Scanner integration (Python/Node.js), Cache behavior (SQLite + JSON), MCP protocol compliance, AST parsing and token optimization
- **Performance Targets**: <1s scan time, 99.7% token reduction
- **Quality Gates**: ESLint, TypeScript strict, test coverage >80%"

#### 2. Quality Gate Criteria by Change Type
"I need different criteria for different changes:
**For Feature Changes**:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests cover added functionality
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- ESLint and TypeScript checks pass

**For Core Changes**:
- Full test suite validation
- Performance benchmarks within targets
- Integration tests across all scanners
- Cache behavior validation"

#### 3. Collaboration Response Templates
"When system-developer says 'Feature X implemented, please validate test coverage', I need to:
1. Analyze changed files and test impact
2. Run targeted test suites
3. Check coverage gaps
4. Execute broader regression tests if core changes
5. Report results with specific recommendations"

#### 4. Testing Constraints
"I need explicit boundaries:
- **Never** run destructive tests on real package environments
- **Always** use isolated test environments with mocks
- **Limit** test execution to <10 seconds total
- **Require** all tests pass before marking tasks complete
- **Isolate** tests to prevent interference and side effects"

## devops-engineer

### What They Said Works Well
- Clear tool permissions already defined

- **Testing**: Vitest with 67 passing tests, requires sequential runs
- **Package Management**: npm with ES modules and import maps
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing
- **Key Commands**: `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`
- **Architecture**: Modular MCP server with SQLite cache and language scanners"

#### 2. Concrete Action Scenarios
"I need specific triggers instead of generic 'CI/CD operations':
- Tests failing in CI but passing locally
- Build failures due to TypeScript errors or import issues  
- npm audit security vulnerabilities need patching
- GitHub Actions workflow needs updating
- Performance regression in package scanning (>1 second)
- Cache corruption requiring SQLite rebuild
- Branch management for feature releases"

#### 3. MCP Server Operations
"I need MCP-specific operations guidance:
**Development Workflow**:
- Local Testing: `npm run dev` for watch mode development
- Integration Testing: Test both Python and Node.js scanner environments
- Performance Validation: Ensure token optimization (99.7% reduction) maintained
- Cache Management: Monitor SQLite cache performance and fallback behavior

**Deployment Considerations**:
- MCP servers run in Claude Desktop/Code environments
- No traditional 'deployment' - published via npm registry
- Version tagging critical for client compatibility
- Breaking changes require major version bumps"

#### 4. Specific Handoff Scripts
"I need exact delegation examples:
- **To test-architect**: 'CI tests are flaky, passing/failing intermittently. The Shell-RPC tests show timeout issues. Need you to investigate mock environment stability and adjust timeout thresholds.'
- **To system-developer**: 'TypeScript compilation failing after dependency update. Need you to fix type compatibility issues in src/scanners/ while maintaining strict type checking.'"

- Cache operations: 40x faster with SQLite (0.03ms vs 1.2ms) ✅ ACHIEVED  
- Token optimization: 99.7% reduction on large files ✅ ACHIEVED
- Memory footprint: <100MB for full scans
- Response times: scan ~150ms, read ~10ms, cache hits ~5ms"

#### 3. Measurement Standards
"I need explicit measurement criteria:
- All performance claims must include before/after metrics
- Use consistent benchmarking environments (same hardware, Node.js version)
- Measure actual package environments (real Python/Node.js projects)
- Include statistical significance in performance comparisons"

#### 4. Performance vs Functionality Trade-offs
"I need clear boundaries:

**Warning (>20K tokens)**:
- Optimization recommended
- Smart extraction strategies

**File Size Triggers**:
- >100KB files: Always optimize
- >50KB TypeScript: Use ts-morph

- Edit/MultiEdit/Write: Implement optimizations
- Bash: Test optimization results

**Prohibited**:
- No git operations
- No TodoWrite (optimization is focused)
- No documentation creation"

#### 4. Delegation Examples with Token Counts
"I need specific handoff scenarios:
- **To system-developer**: 'Implement AST extraction in src/adapters/typescript.ts to reduce token count from 50K to 5K using ts-morph, maintaining public API accuracy'
- **From scanner-engineer**: 'Scanner output is 100K tokens for 500 packages, need reduction to <20K while preserving package metadata'"

- Performance target: <300ms for 100 packages
- Must support cross-platform paths (Windows/Linux/macOS)"

#### 3. Error Handling Patterns
"I need specific error responses:
- Package manager not found → Graceful fallback with clear message
- Corrupted package metadata → Skip package, log warning, continue
- Permission errors → Suggest solutions, don't crash scanner
- Virtual environment detection failure → Multiple detection strategies"

#### 4. Concrete Invocation Examples
"Instead of generic triggers, I need:
- 'Scanner failing for Poetry in virtual environments'
- 'Need to implement scanner for Maven with support for pom.xml'
- 'Package discovery not working in pnpm workspaces'
- 'Performance issues with scanning 1000+ npm packages'
- 'Scanner returning incorrect version for scoped packages'"

2. Only migrate documents where ALL tasks are COMPLETED
3. For TODO.md: Extract ONLY completed tasks to history
4. Never migrate documents with pending/incomplete work
5. Always verify task completion status before migration"
